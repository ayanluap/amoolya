Jeff assists clients in developing long-term\n              investment strategies that help each client solve financial issues\n              and position them to achieve all that is important to them. His\n              clients include individuals, families, retirement plan sponsors\n              and institutional trustees. <br />\n              Jeff was a 2005 founding member of a similar independent\n              registered investment advisor firm, where he honed in on his\n              vision for what became Amoolya group of consutlant. He has been a\n              financial professional in a variety of capacities since 2000,\n              gaining seasoned experience from advisory positions at Mass\n              Mutual, American Express and GE Financial. <br />\n              After a few years of encouragement, Jeff recruited his father,\n              Amoolya group of consutlant, to join Amoolya group of consutlant\n              as a follow up to Dan’s own seasoned career as an accountant and\n              CFO.
